In the 1980s, as a crime wave engulfed the nation, lawmakers made it much harder for judges and parole boards to exercise discretion in making such decisions. States and the federal government began instituting mandatory sentences and, in some cases, abolished parole, making it less important to evaluate individual offenders. Wisconsin has been among the most eager and expansive users of Northpointe's risk assessment tool in sentencing decisions. In 2012, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections launched the use of the software throughout the state. It is used at each step in the prison system, from sentencing to parole.},

Yet there is little understanding of how organizations use these methods in practice. This study explores how organizations view and use explainability for stakeholder consumption. We find that, currently, the majority of deployments are not for end users affected by the model but rather for machine learning engineers, who use explainability to debug the model itself. There is thus a gap between explainability in practice and the goal of transparency, since explanations primarily serve internal stakeholders rather than external ones. Our study synthesizes the limitations of current explainability techniques that hamper their use for end users. To facilitate end user interaction, we develop a framework for establishing clear goals for explainability. We end by discussing concerns raised regarding explainability.},

  abstract = {Only recently have data mining results been thought to aid human interpretability. Explanations are useful to understand the reasons why (or why not) the model has (or hasn't) achieved a given decision. Counterfactual explanations aim to explain why not the model yield an expected decision. A counterfactual explanation is usually done by a post-hoc algorithm which often requires access to training data or model details. Also, the majority of such algorithms do not generate robust explanations, once they assume the model is noise-free and will not be updated over time. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, training data-independent algorithm to provide robust counterfactual explanations. The proposed method generates data samples around the instance to be explained and builds a K-Associated Optimal Graph (KAOG) with those data. KAOG allows measuring how intertwined the data examples are regarding their classes. This way, the explanation method can search for an example that relies on a noise-free area in the attribute space, granting trust to the explanation. Experiment results on counterfactual feasibility and distance from query data show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when compared to ten state-of-the-art methods on three data sets.},

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning explainability has developed rapidly in recent years. However, clustering explainability has lagged behind. Here, we demonstrate the first adaptation of model-agnostic explainability methods to explain unsupervised clustering. We present two novel "algorithm-agnostic" explainability methods -- global permutation percent change (G2PC) and local perturbation percent change (L2PC) -- that identify feature importance globally to a clustering algorithm and locally to the clustering of individual samples. The methods are (1) easy to implement and (2) broadly applicable across clustering algorithms, which could make them highly impactful. We demonstrate the utility of the methods for explaining five popular clustering methods on low-dimensional synthetic datasets and on high-dimensional functional network connectivity data extracted from a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset of 151 individuals with schizophrenia and 160 controls. Our results are consistent with existing literature while also shedding new light on how changes in brain connectivity may lead to schizophrenia symptoms. We further compare the explanations from our methods to an interpretable classifier and find them to be highly similar. Our proposed methods robustly explain multiple clustering algorithms and could facilitate new insights into many applications. We hope this study will greatly accelerate the development of the field of clustering explainability.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

The demand for reliable explanation generation surges, yet unsupervised models remain underexplored in this regard. To bridge this gap, we introduce a method for generating counterfactual (CF) explanations in unsupervised node representation learning. We identify the most important subgraphs that cause a significant change in the k-nearest neighbors of a node of interest in the learned embedding space upon perturbation. The k-nearest neighbor-based CF explanation method provides simple, yet pivotal, information for understanding unsupervised downstream tasks, such as top-k link prediction and clustering. Consequently, we introduce UNR-Explainer for generating expressive CF explanations for Unsupervised Node Representation learning methods based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on diverse datasets for unsupervised GraphSAGE and DGI. Our codes are available at https://github.com/hjkng/unrexplainer.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

The development of explainable AI can enhance the understanding and performance of these models. However, existing techniques often struggle to provide convincing explanations that non-experts easily understand, and they cannot accurately identify models' intrinsic decision-making processes. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a counterfactual explanation (CE) model that balances plausibility and faithfulness. This model generates easy-to-understand visual explanations by making minimum changes necessary in images without altering the pixel data. Instead, the proposed method identifies internal concepts and filters learned by models and leverages them to produce plausible counterfactual explanations. The provided explanations reflect the internal decision-making process of the model, thus ensuring faithfulness to the model.},

However, prototypes alone are rarely sufficient to represent the gist of the complexity. In order for users to construct better mental models and understand complex data distributions, we also need criticism to explain what are not captured by prototypes. Motivated by the Bayesian model criticism framework, we develop MMD-critic which efficiently learns prototypes and criticism, designed to aid human interpretability. A human subject pilot study shows that the MMD-critic selects prototypes and criticism that are useful to facilitate human understanding and reasoning. We also evaluate the prototypes selected by MMD-critic via a nearest prototype classifier, showing competitive performance compared to baselines.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

An intriguing class of explanations is through counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction. We posit that effective counterfactual explanations should satisfy two properties: feasibility of the counterfactual actions given user context and constraints, and diversity among the counterfactuals presented. To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries, outperforming prior approaches to generating diverse counterfactuals. We provide an implementation of the framework at https://github.com/microsoft/DiCE.},

Many combinatorial optimization problems can be posed in this framework. For example, a well-known location problem and the maximization of certain boolean polynomials are in this class. We present a family of algorithms that involve the partial enumeration of all sets of cardinality q and then a greedy selection of the remaining elements, q = 0,..., K - l. For fixed K, the qth member of this family requires {$<$}tex-math{$>\$$}O(n{\textasciicircum}\{q+1\})\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} computations and is guaranteed to achieve at least {$<$}tex-math{$>\$$}[1-({\textbackslash}frac\{K-q\}\{K\})({\textbackslash}frac\{K-q-1\}\{K-q\}){\textasciicircum}\{K-q\}]{\textbackslash}times 100\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} percent of the optimum value.

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

Then we consider the counterfactual generation problem for k-means and Gaussian clustering assuming Euclidean distance. Our approach takes as input the factual, the target cluster, a binary mask indicating actionable or immutable features and a plausibility factor specifying how far from the cluster boundary the counterfactual should be placed. In the k-means clustering case, analytical mathematical formulas are presented for computing the optimal solution, while in the Gaussian clustering case (assuming full, diagonal, or spherical covariances) our method requires the numerical solution of a nonlinear equation with a single parameter only. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through illustrative examples and quantitative experimental comparisons.},

  abstract = {The computational complexity of the partition, 0-1 subset sum, unbounded subset sum, 0-1 knapsack and unbounded knapsack problems and their multiple variants were studied in numerous papers in the past where all the weights and profits were assumed to be integers. We re-examine here the computational complexity of all these problems in the setting where the weights and profits are allowed to be any rational numbers. We show that all of these problems in this setting become strongly NP-complete and, as a result, no pseudo-polynomial algorithm can exist for solving them unless P=NP. Despite this result we show that they all still admit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.},
