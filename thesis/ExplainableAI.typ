= Explainable AI
The field of machine learning has made great strides in recent years, resulting in much better classification accuracy and more complex models with potentially millions of parameters. Given the impressive performance of these models, industry has been quick to adopt them into their AI systems in production. 

However, these models are often used as black boxes: a tool which, when given an input, produces an output with no explanation or justification of how or why the model returned the given result. Advanced machine learning models have been proven to work in critical fields like cancer diagnosis or bank loan approval @bhattExplainableMachineLearning2020 @estevaDermatologistlevelClassificationSkin2017, meaning their predictions can have great impact on users. 

// Local vs. Global
// Model-specific vs. Model-agnostic
// Post-hoc vs. Intrinsic
